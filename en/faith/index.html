<h2>in memory of faith roberts 4/4/25</h2>
<hr>
<div style="width: 60%;">
    <p> faith, you meant so much to everyone around you, me included. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> i know we weren't the closest when you died and i regret that everyday </p>
    <p> i wish that you could have seen the people around you grow old and that it didn't have to end like this </p>
    <p> i wish that we could have been faster and i wish that i could've helped</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> i guess that there's no point trying to worry myself with what could and what couldn't have happened</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> you showed me so many things which i still cling to today and i sometimes wonder what my life, and the lives </p>
    <p> of others around you would have been without you. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> i know it's kinda late to write anything like this but i feel like i should write something too</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> sneed on, faith</p>
    <p> note: since this is more serious i don't think i want to translate this to toki pona </p>
    <p> note two: this will be added to</p>
